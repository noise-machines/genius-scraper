{"lyrics":"Maybe cause I'm eatin\nAnd these bastards fiend for they grub\nI carry pumps like I serve gasoline to these scrubs\nHave you seen my Aston leanin on dubs\nAnd they can't afford chrome so they puttin vaseline on they hubs\nI'm lookin for a girl with a ass like Trina to rub\nTake home and let her watch the plasma screen in the tub\nThese niggas hate I move as smooth as castor cream in the club\nAnd dont pass my green or my bub\nBut I'm a fly nigga that don't do much to pull her and dick her\nEveryday I'm poppin a tag and pullin a sticker\nEveryday I'm switchin the tags and pullin up sicker\nEvery \"K\" I'm loadin the mags with bullets to flicker\nAnd I ain't hesitatin homie I'm pullin it quicker\nSo you can act tough After a few pulls of some liquor\nGotta pull it on niggas\nAnd they won't be goin nowhere for a while\nThey might as well pull out a snicker Ye-Ye-Yea\n\n[Hook]\nForgive me father for I have sinned\nBut look at all this money that I spend\nAnd look at all this jewlery that I'm in\nAnd look at all the places that I've been\nAnd look at all the women in those brims\nLook at the blue flames that I'm in\nI look at all the bullshit that theres been\nAnd if I had another chance I'd do it again\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnywhere the kid move you know the hammers'll be with me\nPokin out the shirt like a Pamela Lee titty\nI went on tour brought the samples of D wit me\nCame back a month later bought a Lambo for three-fifty\nThink I throw you grams if you read with me\nJust because you see me on the camera with P. Diddy\nDammit we P-driddy?? Now I got G with me\nAlong with the third leg that I be rammin in these bitties\nI keep the revolver you hope my gun'll jam\nBut with the scope its gonna blam\nThe infra put freckles on your face like Opie Cunningham\nThats why I'm watched by the Feds and scoped by Uncle Sam\nDope and hunn-ed (hundred) grams rope and hunn-ed grams\nAt the same time an artist get to open Summer Jam\nHope you understand or use better sense\nThese niggas dont want no beef they want lawsuit settlements Nigga!\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'm in a waggy when I'm passin by ya\nWith a baby girl who suck harder than Maggie on a pacifier\nWhat I'm smokin'll have you aggie as your last supplier\nWhen you can smell it through the baggie you know that's some fire\nGettin stressed by these hotties is regular\nI got a magazine to press to your body like editors\nTest me somebody I'm beggin ya\nI got the gatling gun like Jesse The Body in Predator\nI'm a hustler I dont sling no rocks to the fiends now\nGot dudes who sit on corners like a boxer between rounds\nAny other dude who dish rocks want beef\nCause I chop rocks bigger than Chris Rock front teeth\nI'm the nigga tearin the walls up in your miss in exchange for a small cup\nOf the Cris\nAnd while you at probation fillin a small cup full of piss\nI'm in a coupe with a roof that ball up like a fist (Catch up!)","annotation_count":11,"api_path":"/songs/4","description":{"plain":"?"},"embed_content":"<div id='rg_embed_link_4' class='rg_embed_link' data-song-id='4'>Read <a
